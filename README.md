# Hey, I'm Mahmut

Software developer who builds tools I actually want to use. I work across the full stack — from Spring Boot backends to React frontends, desktop apps with Electron/Tauri, and VS Code extensions.

## What I Build

**AI-Powered Tools**
- [book-reader](https://github.com/mahmutsalman/book-reader) — Context-aware AI dictionary for books, manga & comics with Neural TTS, OCR, and LLM support. Built for language learners.
- [SpeedReader](https://github.com/mahmutsalman/SpeedReader) — RSVP speed reading app with AI-powered speaker detection
- [LookForProject](https://github.com/mahmutsalman/LookForProject) — Project discovery tool built with Python

**Desktop Applications**
- [notes-audio-video-app](https://github.com/mahmutsalman/notes-audio-video-app) — Audio/video note-taking with screen recording, built with Electron + React + TypeScript
- [speak-songs](https://github.com/mahmutsalman/speak-songs) — Language learning through music with vocal isolation and word-level playback (Tauri + React + Python)
- [focus-writer](https://github.com/mahmutsalman/focus-writer) — Minimalist distraction-free writing app
- [project-steps](https://github.com/mahmutsalman/project-steps) — Desktop task manager with visual step tracking

## Background

Started with college projects in Java and C — things like CPU design in Logisim, network programming, and algorithm implementations. Since then I've been building the tools and apps I use daily. Most of my projects focus on productivity, language learning, and developer experience.
